//write an algorithm for counting sort
Let's assume that, array A of size N needs to be sorted.
•	Initialize the auxillary array Aux[] as 0. The size of this array should be ≥max(A[]).
•	Traverse array A and store the count of occurrence of each element in the appropriate index of the Aux array, which means, execute Aux[A[i]]++ for each i, where i ranges from [0,N−1].
•	Initialize the empty array sortedA[]
•	Traverse array Aux and copy i into sortedA for Aux[i] number of times where 0≤i≤max(A[]).
