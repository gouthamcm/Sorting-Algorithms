//write an algorithm for cycle sort
 Step 1:Start
 Step 2:Declare the variables i,a[4],j,count,b
 Step 3:Read the values
 Step 4: start a for loop with i=0
 Step 5: start a while loop in the former loop
      5.1 keep initialising count=0 every time the loop runs
      5.2 start a for loop by intialising j=0 in the former while loop
      5.3 if a[i]>a[j] increment count value by 1      //to count number of elements lesser than i th element
      5.4 Repeat the loop by incrementing value of j by 1 till j<4
   Step 6: Store the value of the element in position with index number equal to number of elements lesser than i th element in
          a variable b// b=a[count]
   Step 7 :transfer the element in i th position to the position with index number equal to number of elements lesser than it//
           a[count]=a[i]
   Step 8:Store the value of b in a[i] and repeat the while loop till the condition a[count] not equals to a[i] becpmes false.
   // to make a[i] as our target element and to set it in position with index number equal to number of elements lesser than it. 
   Step 9:Now increment the value of i by 1 and repeat the steps 5-8 till i<4
   Step 10:Print the sorted array of elements
   Step 11:End

  
   //code
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
   int i,a[4],j,count=0,b;
    for(i=0;i<4;i++)
